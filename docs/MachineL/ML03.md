# ML03 - 无监督学习 (Unsupervised Learning)

### Cocktail party problem algorithm
SVD(奇异值分解) 函数

```Octave
[W, s, v] = svd((repmat(sum(x.*x, 1), size(x, 1), 1).*x)*x');
```

Of the following examples, which would you address using an `Unsupervised Learning Algorithm`? (Check all that apply.)

A - Given email labeled as spam/not spam, learn a spam filter.  
B - Given a set of news articles found on the web, group them into set of articles about the same story.  
C - Given a database of customer data, automatically discover market segments and group customers into different market segments.  
D - Given a dataset of patients diagnosed as either having diabetes or not, learn to classify new patients as having diabetes or not.
