# ML53 - Machine learning system design - Error metrics for skewed classes

### 不对称性分类的误差评估

**Precision/Recall**  
- Precision [查准率 $\frac{TP}{TP+FP}$]: (Of all patients where we predicted y = 1, what fraction actually has cancer?)
- Recall [召回率 $\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$]: (Of al patients that actually have cancer, what fraction did we correctly detect as having cancer?)
