### Arthur Samuel 's Machine Learning Definition
Arthur Samuel (1959). Machine Learning: Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.

### Tom Mitchell 's Machine Learning Definition
Tom Mitchell (1998) Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T
and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E.
