# ML02 - 监督学习 (Supervised Learning)

You’re running a company, and you want to develop learning algorithms to address each of two problems.  
Problem 1: You have a large inventory of identical items. You want to predict how many of these items will sell over the next 3 months.  
Problem 2: You’d like software to examine individual customer accounts, and for each account decide if it has been hacked/compromised.  
Should you treat these as classification or as regression problems?

A - Treat both as classification problems.  
B - Treat problem 1 as a classification problem, problem 2 as a regression problem.  
C - Treat problem 1 as a regression problem, problem 2 as a classification problem.  
D - Treat both as regression problems.
