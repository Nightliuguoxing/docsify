# ML27 - Regularization - The problem of overfitting

### 过拟合问题

Addressing overfitting:   
Options:  
1. Reduce number of features.
    - Manually select which features to keep.
    - Model selection algorithm (later in course).
2. Reqularization.
    - Keep all the features, but reduce magnitude/values of parameters $\theta_j$
    - Works well when we have a lot of features, each of which contributes a bit to predicting $y$.
